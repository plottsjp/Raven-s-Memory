# Raven’s Memory

## What are we making?
* a simple find a match game
* maybe a local leaderboard
* maybe customizable field size
* maybe my own art - we are currently working with some Norse style runes I bought of Etsy a while ago, the seller and listing is gone so I have no idea if my original purchase included a commercial use case (and this will be a free app anyways). If you know who the original artist - please let me know.

## Why are we making this app?
* google said that I have to be “active” or they will close my developer account, this seems like a permanent closure and I’d prefer to keep my options open. So here we are with 1 month to build an app.

## Why put it on GitHub?
* Needed somewhere to put a pricey policy (don’t have a website).

## Why build it with Compose?
* Because, if I’m going to make and release an app just to keep Google happy, I’d like to get something out of it for myself (even if I’d rather just be asleep).
